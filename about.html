      <p>
        I’m passionate about helping people to have a fulfilling and meaningful work life.
      </p>
      <p>
        We spend so much of our time at work - why shouldn’t we love what we do!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve spent over seven years as a consultant working with organisations to build great places to work where people are able to thrive and be their best.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve worked with CEOs and leadership teams to help them improve their company culture and I’ve worked with individuals to help them feel more engaged at work.  I've also been involved in setting up intern programmes and mentoring young professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hello Future is my way of helping those who are starting out in their career to get to where they want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m new enough to the workforce to remember what it’s like, but experienced enough to be able to pass on the tips and tricks I’ve learnt through the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m excited to work with you and can’t wait to get started!
